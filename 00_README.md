# 2024-CUSA-Football-Analysis
This project analyzes the preforamces of 2024 NCAA QB's. I have used it to talk about the upcoming 2025 season.

Play By Play Data from the 2024 NCAA Football season. Desired QB's plays were saved as subsets of the data to compare against each other and easier access than having to change QB names.
